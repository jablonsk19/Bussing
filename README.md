# What is HTA about?
HTA aspires to be the tool of choice for metallurgists and researchers wishing to augment Thermo-Calc with the ability to develop and simulate homogenization heat treatments based on research done by my father, Dr. Paul Jablonski.  Previously, I implemented software for him personally after he mentioned to me the slow process of analyzing output files from Thermo-Calc for further processing.  This program is a polished, public, and free (but do see https://www.patreon.com/HTAssistant to help me out!) version of that software.

# Installation
Note that HTA is relatively new, and like any software, there might be issues and bugs that haven't been discovered yet.  

# Contribution
**While using HTA is free, contribution is much appreciated and can now be done through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/HTAssistant!**  The amount of support I receive will be an important factor in determining how much time and effort I will put into fixing bugs and adding features!

## Sources
(I've read multiple papers to better understand the problem so I could solve it.  There's nothing here now, but that will change soon.)

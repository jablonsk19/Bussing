# What is Bussing about?
The first thing that you need to know about Bussing is that **it is an incomplete tool.**  Until it is finished, it is highly recommended that you **do not download any version of it** because its behavior is not verified!  

When Bussing is finished, it will be the tool of choice for metallurgists and researchers wishing to augment Thermo-Calc with the ability to develop and simulate homogenization heat treatments based on research done by my father, Dr. Paul Jablonski.  This program is a polished, public, and free\* version of software that I have previously implemented for him personally after he mentioned to me the slow process of analyzing output files from Thermo-Calc for further processing.  

\*Contribution is appreciated, though (link coming soon), and will be an important factor in maintaining the software and adding features!

(I've read multiple papers to better understand the problem so I could solve it.  There's nothing here now, but that will change soon.)
